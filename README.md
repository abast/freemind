# FreeMind for macOS

FreeMind 1.0.1 with **macOS font rendering fixes**. This repository contains a patched version of FreeMind that correctly renders fonts on macOS, solving the blurry/incorrect font display issues present in the standard FreeMind distribution.

## About

FreeMind is a free mind mapping application written in Java. This setup uses Java 8 to ensure compatibility and proper rendering on macOS.

## Requirements

- Java 8 (Java SE Runtime Environment 1.8.0 or later)
- macOS (tested on macOS Ventura and later)

## Installation

### Option 1: Terminal-based Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abast/freemind.git ~/project_src/freemind
   ```

2. Make the launcher script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x ~/project_src/freemind/freemind.sh
   ```

3. Add an alias to your shell configuration (`~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`):
   ```bash
   echo 'alias freemind="cd ~/project_src/freemind && bash freemind.sh"' >> ~/.bashrc
   ```

   Or for zsh:
   ```bash
   echo 'alias freemind="cd ~/project_src/freemind && bash freemind.sh"' >> ~/.zshrc
   ```

4. Reload your shell configuration:
   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc  # or source ~/.zshrc
   ```

5. Run FreeMind:
   ```bash
   freemind
   ```

### Option 2: macOS Application Bundle (Recommended)

To run FreeMind without keeping a terminal window open, create an Application bundle:

1. Follow steps 1-2 from Option 1

2. Run the installation script (will ask for your password):
   ```bash
   cd ~/project_src/freemind
   ./install_macos_app.sh
   ```

3. This will create `FreeMind.app` in `/Applications/`

4. Launch FreeMind from Spotlight (âŒ˜+Space, type "FreeMind"), Launchpad, or Applications folder

## macOS Rendering Fix

**This version includes a modified `freemind.jar` (12.9 MB) with font rendering patches specifically for macOS.** The standard FreeMind 1.0.1 distribution (11 MB) has severe font rendering issues on macOS where text appears blurry or incorrectly sized.

This patched version was extracted from the official FreeMind macOS DMG bundle and includes:

- **Patched freemind.jar** with macOS-specific font rendering fixes
- Uses Java 8 for optimal compatibility
- Properly configured classpath and Java system properties
- Memory allocation set to 256MB (`-Xmx256M`)
- Correct base directory configuration for plugins and resources

**Note:** The standard FreeMind binary distribution from SourceForge does NOT include these macOS fixes. This repository provides the working macOS version.

For detailed information about the modifications, see [MODIFICATIONS.md](MODIFICATIONS.md).

## Usage

### Terminal Method
Simply type `freemind` in your terminal to launch the application.

### Application Bundle Method
Double-click the FreeMind icon in your Applications folder or launch via Spotlight.

## Auto-save Files

FreeMind automatically saves temporary files to `~/.freemind/`. If FreeMind crashes, check this directory for auto-saved files:
```bash
ls -la ~/.freemind/
```

Temporary files are named like `FM_unnamed[numbers].mm`.

## Troubleshooting

### Java not found
If you get "java: command not found", install Java 8:
```bash
brew install --cask adoptopenjdk8
```

### Rendering issues
Make sure you're using Java 8. Check your Java version:
```bash
java -version
```

Should output something like: `java version "1.8.0_xxx"`

### Permission denied
Make sure the script is executable:
```bash
chmod +x ~/project_src/freemind/freemind.sh
```

## File Locations

- **Application files**: `~/project_src/freemind/`
- **User preferences**: `~/.freemind/auto.properties`
- **Auto-save files**: `~/.freemind/FM_unnamed*.mm`
- **Recent files**: Listed in `~/.freemind/auto.properties`
